The effects of sensory quality on the minimally processed Chinese water chestnut (Eleocharis tuberose) by mild heat pre-treatment at storage period were still unclear and need to be more precisely determined. Mild heat pre-treatment (58℃, 20 min) can effectively retard browning of Chinese water chestnut sliced. Using quantitative descriptive analysis method to make profiles of sensory quality of minimally processed Chinese water chestnut during storage, results showed that mild heat pre-treatment may be effective to keep color, texture and flavor of Chinese water chestnuts sliced. The 12 major sensory descriptors of Chinese water chestnut sliced was obtain by 10 sensory assessors. The main sensory descriptors of minimally processed Chinese water chestnut conclude color description language (milky, yellow-green and brown), texture description language (moist, rough, fibrous and brittle) and flavor description language (fresh, corn flavor, fragrance, alcohol taste and moldy smell). Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that often use to analysis data obtain from quantitative descriptive analysis. Three main components of minimally processed Chinese water chestnut were selected by principal component analysis. The weight of the first principal component was 24.81%, and major features were milky white, yellow-green, brown and rough. The weight of the second principal components was 22.33%, and major features were fresh, faint scent and mildew. The weight of the third principal components was 13.74%, and major feature was fibrous. Sensory quality control of the minimally process water chestnuts should pay attention to the quality of color (yellow-green and browning), texture (coarse and fibrous) and flavor (moldy smell). © 2015, Editorial Office of Journal of CIFST.
