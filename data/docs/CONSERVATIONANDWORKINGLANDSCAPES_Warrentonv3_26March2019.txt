EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Pacific Northwest Coast Landscape Conservation Design (LCD) partnership hosted a one-day workshop in Warrenton, Oregon focused on conservation and working landscapes in northwest Oregon. A diverse collection of community members and stakeholders gathered here to learn more about landscape conservation and working lands and to foster a better understanding of their individual and collective values. Discussions focused on finding ways to maintain resilient landscapes by keeping working lands working and other strategies. 
The goals of the workshop were to identify: 1) identify conservation and land use values of stakeholders in northwest Oregon; 2) identify positive efforts and current and emerging challenges to landscape-scale conservation in the region; and 3) identify key questions and information to inform potential strategies to support working landscapes, community values, and conservation goals in the region. The LCD is hosting workshops throughout the coastal ecoregion of Oregon and Washington in order to understand local issues throughout the geography. The goal is to find common issues across the entire ecoregion.  
About 50 people representing large and small forest landowners, farm producers, conservation organizations, tribes, agencies, and academic institutions convened to learn about the values that different stakeholders and members of the region hold for the landscape. They also learned of the challenges to achieving sustainable working lands, local economies, and wildlife populations, as well as strategies to balance all those values. Lisa DeBruyckere of Creative Resource Strategies, LLC facilitated the meeting. 
Tom Miewald, USFWS Project Coordinator, set the stage for the meeting by emphasizing the need for strong rural economies while conserving native fish and wildlife habitat. He talked about predicted key changes and stressors on working landscapes and conservation in the region, and provided examples of other similar approaches in the United States and in the world. He expressed a desired outcome is ultimately developing strategies that create sustainable working landscapes for people and native fish and wildlife. 
Caucus groups representing industrial forests, small woodland landowners, small agricultural landowners, recreation/tourism, conservation groups, and agencies, shared the answers to six questions their caucus groups were asked in advance of the workshop. At the conclusion of the presentations, caucused convened with additional representatives from their groups to provide additional content to the answers, which was then shared with all workshop attendees. 
Participants then formed breakout groups comprised of a diversity of workshop attendees to address potential collaborative steps that could be taken in the region to advance mutual interests and achieve the type of working lands and conservation landscape that meets the values and interests of people living in the region. The event concluded with a rundown of the highlights from the meeting as well as key next steps, including plans to follow up on this workshop to see where we can begin tackling some of the challenges we heard as well as hosting a scenario planning workshop in June 2019. 


Introduction to Landscape Conservation Design 
Tom Miewald set the stage for the meeting by emphasizing the need for strong rural economies while conserving native fish and wildlife habitat. He talked about predicted key changes and stressors on working landscapes and conservation in the region over the next 50-75 years, noting that landscape conservation design is focused on thinking across geographic scales with networks of organizations and people. A “think regionally, act locally” approach across ecosystems, the landscape, at varying geographic scales, and across jurisdictions and ownerships can work toward achieving a landscape that meets the expectations, goals, and values of people living in the region. Tom provided examples of other similar approaches in the United States and in the world. He expressed a desired outcome is ultimately developing strategies that create sustainable working landscapes for people and native fish and wildlife.

CAUCUS PRESENTATIONS 
Prior to the workshop, local representatives were asked to convene up to five individuals working in the following areas: industrial forestry, small family foresters, agriculture, the conservation community, recreation/tourism, to answer the following questions: 
• 
What values do you strongly hold for conservation and land management in northwest Oregon? 

• 
How is land use, resource management, and/or conservation important to the quality of life in northwest Oregon? 

• 
What do you see as your primary goals and objectives in managing and conserving land in northwest Oregon?  (near term and 50-year outlook) 

• 
What are big impediments to managing and/or conserving land in northwest Oregon? (near term and 50-year outlook) 

• 
Do you have ideas or suggestions for how to overcome these impediments, particularly through collaborative engagement among stakeholders? 

• 
Is there anything else you would like to add? 


The following individuals convened each of the caucus groups before the community meeting to develop responses to each of the panel questions: 
• 
Large forest landowners—Jed Arnold, Hampton Family Forests 

• 
Agriculture representatives—Teresa Retzlaff, 46 North Farm 

• 
Recreation/Tourism—Kate Cox, Kate Cox Consulting

The information on the following pages was submitted in advance and in writing by each of the different 
caucus groups (text in black). After each of the caucus groups presented, caucus groups convened around 
the room to obtain additional input and clarification from workshop attendees (purple) as well as highlight 
the top three challenges (red) and identify three strategies (green) to address those challenges. 

Large Forest Landowners 
• 
Jed Arnold, Outreach & Stewardship Coordinator, Hampton Family Forests 

• 
Austin Himes, Sustainability Manager, GreenWood Resources, Inc. 

• 
Peter Ninteman, Forester, NWOR, Weyerhaeuser Company 

• 
Kathryn Olson, Area Forester, Lewis & Clark Tree Farms (GreenWood Resources) 

• 
Tim Shiel, Area Woodlands Manager, Stimson Lumber Company 

• 
Meghan Tuttle, Western Environmental Affairs Manager, Weyerhaeuser Company 


1. What values do you strongly hold for conservation and land management in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
Working forests and conservation are compatible land-use goals. Thoughtfully managed forests provide many benefits for the environment, wildlife and people. 

• 
Manage for long-term sustainability of the forests, providing renewable materials, habitat, recreation and clean water for generations. 

• 
Forest managers think about and plan for the future everyday – long-term sustainability is integral to business and way-of-life. 

• 
Stewardship is one of our core values 

• 
Resourceful and disciplined forest management produces long-term social, economic and conservation benefits 

• 
Strong forest and wood products markets and the local mill infrastructure they support ensure forests remain forests and sustain rural economies 



2. How is land use, resource management, and/or conservation important to the quality of life in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
Conservation and land management are inextricably intertwined 

• 
We are members of the communities we manage land in -our quality of life is tied to our management practices 

• 
Working forests provide conservation benefits including wildlife habitat, clean water and outdoor recreation – all of which are severely impacted by conversion of forestland to other uses 

• 
In addition to their broader economic contributions, working forests and associated manufacturing directly provide well-paying jobs vital to the economic and social fabric of our communities 

• 
For all of the reasons above, stewardship of our forests for long-term sustainability is both a matter of professional integrity and pride for us as well as a means of ensuring quality of life for ourselves and our families 



3. What do you see as your primary goals and objectives in managing and conserving land in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
Ensuring that policy makers and influencers recognize the relationship between a healthy forest sector, healthy environments, and healthy rural economies 

• 
Continue focusing on science-based management practices to keep working forestlands economically viable while providing environmental benefits 

• 
Making a strong connection between working forests and benefits to society and the environment 

• 
Getting broad recognition of the wisdom of valuing forestry over other land uses based on the social, environmental, and economic benefits working forests provide 

• 
Supporting infrastructure capacity and capital improvements needed to support a health wood products market 




4. What are big impediments to managing and/or conserving land in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
Lack of community and institutional awareness of forest management practices, industry sustainability and the benefits working forests provide to water, wildlife and carbon storage 

• 
Population increases and ongoing pressure for conversion / development to accommodate growth 

• 
Lack of regulatory stability and the need for policy tools that focus on incentives and science rather than political considerations 

• 
Access to an educated and trained workforce 

• 
Shifting demographics and urbanization that disconnects people from the products they consume 

• 
Litigation driven agendas rather than collaborative efforts 

• 
Disincentives from regulations that punish land managers for their success at creating habitat for listed species 



5. Do you have ideas or suggestions for how to overcome these impediments, particularly through collaborative engagement among stakeholders? 
• 
Build up relationships and trust with all stakeholders and seek opportunities to work together on discrete goals – building a foundation from which big-picture issues can be collaboratively addressed 

• 
Increase social license to operate by developing collaborative message from the conservation, forestry and agricultural communities on the importance of forest and farmland mgmt 

• 
Development of economic incentives for provision of ecosystem services 

• 
Build a coalition that focuses on landscape-scale issues and seeks collaborative strategies to keep multiple-benefit landscapes intact 

• 
Promote jobs in the wood products sector as highly-skilled, well-compensated professions 

• 
Improve design and use of mechanisms for protection of ESA species 

• 
Promote a broader understanding and support for the relationship between the wood products sector, environmental benefits, and sustainable communities 



6. Is there anything else panel members would like to add? 
• 
As large private forest land managers, we are seeking to build bridges to span the gap of public understanding of forest management, while promoting working forests as the best choice for NW Oregon private forestlands 

• 
Stakeholders often operate from an assumption of an adversarial relationship. However, when people communicate in a collaborative setting they often learn they share many common goals 

• 
Harvests from state forests are vital to maintaining local mill jobs and infrastructure, as well as the economic vitality of our communities 

• 
Local mills use 100% of logs 

• 
Maintenance of forest roads is vital to wildfire control and continued recreational access 


Top challenges: 
• 
Lack of understanding regarding what we do for science and economy and environment 

• 
Regulatory and perverse incentives – recognition for doing the right thing 

• 
Maintaining diverse economies surrounding natural resources 


Top strategies to address challenges: 
• 
Outreach/education 

• 
Building trust between diverse groups of stakeholders 


• Create/sustain infrastructure and markets workforce development (local)

Small Forest Landowners 
• 
Bonnie and Bob Shumaker, Washington County Chapter of the Oregon Small Woodlands Association 

• 
Susana Gladwin 


1. What values do you strongly hold for conservation and land management in northwest Oregon? 
• 
Recognize the benefit of diverse management in the small woodland community.  There is no right way, and different styles of management benefit different creatures. 

• 
Recognize the value of the three-legged stool of environmental, social and economic benefits of forestland, and have that importance be understood and valued. 

• 
Ongoing education in best management practices. 



2. How is land use, resource management, and/or conservation important to the quality of life in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
Forestland provides clean air, water, carbon sequestering, habitat, jobs and beauty to NW Oregon’s quality of life.  

• 
Oregon’s land use laws keep forest from development, but unengaged landowners often don’t understand options for their land and could benefit from education. 

• 
OSU Extension, OSWA, ODF, NRCS and others are important educational and resource incentive tools. 



3. What do you see as your primary goals and objectives in managing and conserving land in Northwest Oregon? 
Near term 
• 
Back to the three-legged stool.  Specifically, keep up-to-date with best science avoiding extreme environmental “state of fear” tactics.  

• 
We support Oregon’s Forest Protection Laws and the methods in place for changing and improving them. 

• 
The trees on our farm are mostly under 20 years of age. We want to keep them healthy with prudent thinning and encouraging understory development on the areas that used to be pasture. 


50-year outlook 
• 
Leave a legacy that shows sustainable conservation and our love of the land. 

• 
Our long-term goal is to have an uneven-aged forest. By varying thinning and small clear-cuts across the landscape and going toward longer (60+year) rotations, we hope this happens, although we know it will be beyond our lifetime. 



4. What are big impediments to managing and/or conserving land in Northwest Oregon? 
Near term 
• 
Oregon’s 2019 legislature has many bills introduced by urban and environmental groups designed to decrease management opportunities.  Forest management should not come from the legislature.  

• 
Oregon’s Forest Protection Laws have a process to change as needed using science and public input.  This takes longer, but makes a lot more sense than shoving laws through the Legislature. 

• 
Trying to get unengaged landowners educated in management choices. 



50-year outlook 
• The near-term impediments will continue. 

5. Do you have ideas or suggestions for how to overcome these impediments, particularly through collaborative engagement among stakeholders? 
• 
Education of landowners and the public (OFRI does a great job) and continuing research from OSU and other credible institutions.  

• 
Continued outreach through OSU Extension, OSWA, ODF, NRCS. 

• 
Incentives to achieve best management practices (forest health, invasive species removal, pre-commercial thinning, habitat improvement). 

• 
Form collaborative groups when there is a landscape need that can be addressed this way.  This is a long process and can get discouraging, however. 

• 
Landowner involvement in the legislative process. 


Top challenges: 
• 
Increased regs from legislature versus FPA 

• 
Education and communication about the role of SFLOs in region (general public) 

• 
Succession planning 


Top strategies to address challenges: 
• 
Communication strategies telling SFLO story 

• 
Explore alternate revenue streams 

o 
Mills for large diameter wood – cooperative mill 

o 
Carbon – minor forest products

Agriculture Landowners (note: this panel modified the questions that were asked) 
• 
Teresa Retzlaff, 46 North Farm 

• 
Jared Gardener, Nehalem River Ranch 

• 
Wendi LaRue, Melville Farm 

• 
Scott Thompson, Blackberry Bog Farm 

• 
Larry Nelson, Lana Conscious Farm 


1. What are important aspects of the natural and cultural resources in this region that contribute to quality of life? 
• 
We value the clean air and water in our coastal region; it ensures the quality of the food we produce on our farms, something we believe is essential to the health of both individuals and communities. 

• 
We appreciate farming in a climate that supports a wide variety of agricultural activities and crops: produce, fruit, pasture-raised meat, eggs, cut flowers, dairy, and nursery products. 

• 
We value being part of the strong, vibrant communities all along the coast that are increasingly supportive of local agriculture. Local people like seeing farm land in production. ‘Organic’ doesn’t matter as much as ‘local’. 

• 
Honoring the history of agriculture in this region, keeping it alive through family farms producing for our local and regional communities. 


2. Do you have concerns or ideas you would like to share to advance individual and mutual goals? 
• 
Inherently our goals are the same. Farmers want their land to be healthy and productive, and want water to be clean. How can we talk about our sometimes very real differences in a way that is not divisive and antagonistic, but encourages respect? 

• 
There is a paradigm shift happening in consumer attitudes towards their food, with increasing support for buying locally raised meat and locally grown produce, especially if it supports ecologically positive farming practices. How do we as individuals and organizations support this? 

• 
We all need to question whether the way we have ‘always done things’ is working, and if it is the best way forward. 

• 
We need conservation funding that isn’t under constant threat of removal or limited in regional focus.  Seasonal challenges and cash flow result in years when farmers can afford to partner on conservation projects but there might be no regional funding available, and vice versa. 


3. What are your goals and objectives, and what challenges to you face in achieving them? 
Goals 
• 
To see the local farming tradition revived and thriving, contributing to our local economy. 

• 
To raise animals in a sustainable way that does not negatively impact either the environment or the health of the animal. 

• 
Farming in balance with wildlife and nature, it doesn’t have to be either/or. 

• 
Successful transition of agricultural land from one generation to the next. 

• 
Adopting new agricultural practices that can help us to raise food in more ecologically responsible way and also be economically beneficial to the farm. 

• 
Take advantage of agritourism activities and opportunities to engage and educate the public about agriculture. 


Challenges 

• 
Competing with housing development, wildlife land conservation, and industrial ag for affordable farm land. 

• 
Farmers are asked to absorb the cost of higher food production that environmentally responsible practices require. 

• 
Conservation funding focused on finding problems to fix, not on helping farmers who are trying to farm right do it better. 

• 
Our changing climate is less dependable, making it harder to plan seasonal growing practices. 

• 
Regulations and rules that often feel onerous or are not scale-appropriate, and are not well communicated. 

• 
A lack of compassion at best, and at worst celebration among conservationists when a farm land is taken out of ag production and converted to natural resources. This does not engender feelings of trust or mutual respect. 

• 
As an increasing number of older farmers retire or pass away, the transfer of agricultural lands to a new generation of farmers needs to be supported. There is an opportunity to support a new generation of conservation-minded farmers through agricultural land conservation and land trusts. 

• 
There needs to be greater cultural understanding and appreciation about farming and how food is produced, building economic support for farming in ecologically responsible ways. 

• 
Increasing development pressures in coastal communities to support both housing and tourism will continue to put pressure on agricultural lands and local food production. 

• 
Existing infrastructure that supports agriculture on river plains or tideland is aging and at risk. Tide gates are failing, rivers move, there is a constant need for fencing and road repair on farms, how do we address this? 



4. What are big impediments to managing and/or conserving land in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
An apparent lack of concern for the welfare of farmers. Regulators and non-governmental organizations need to be just as concerned about farmers as they are about animal species. 

• 
Lack of regulatory certainty. Increasingly burdensome regulations are causing some farmers to fold and sell out. Regulators and non-governmental organizations need to recognize that working lands must remain profitable while meeting conservation goals. 

• 
Distrustful regulatory relationships. Litigation in the regulatory environment. 

• 
Development, conversion of agricultural land. Zoning must support farming. 

• 
Social resistance to controlling harmful pests. 

• 
Climate change. Changes in ocean chemistry. 




5. Do you have ideas or suggestions for how to overcome these impediments, particularly through collaborative engagement among stakeholders? 
• 
Partner with universities on research projects to help farmers adapt to changing climate, resource scarcity, changing markets. 

• 
Start rewarding and supporting farmers who want to do the right thing from the start, not just look for problems to fix. 

• 
More access to training and support to help farmers achieve better balance between economic realities and conservation goals. More regional support for OSU Extension Service, especially the OSU Center for Small Farms, could help with this. 

• 
Be open to the idea of agricultural land conservation that can incorporate conservation goals while also allowing land to stay in agricultural production. 




6. An additional observation that did not fit into the other slides: 
If you are asking farmers to take on more expensive farming practices to protect the environment, but you as individuals–and the organizations you represent–are not willing to shift your own behavior and spend more on the food you purchase to reward those farmers who are farming responsibly, then this system will never effectively change. Everyone who wants to see more ecologically sound farming in our region needs to literally start putting their money where their mouth is. 
Content added to the caucus: 
• Economic viability of small farms intersects with all topic areas 
Top challenges: 
• 
Navigating programs and resources that fits the sale of smaller farms. 

• 
The focus on fixing the problem, not helping farmers do right from the start. 

• 
Speed of conservation of ag land is too slow to address land succession 


Top strategies to address challenges: 
• 
Scale-appropriate regulations and policies 

• 
More funding for research and education (of agencies, too!) 

• 
Develop state ag finance programs

1. What values do you strongly hold for conservation and land management in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
Structurally diverse and older forests; healthy streams and watersheds; intact and functional systems; strong communities 

• 
Connectivity; seeking common ground; integrity; joy 

• 
Healthy balance between natural ecosystem preservation and intensive land use; providing ecological systems the ability to maintain their natural biological and physical processes; protection of biodiversity 

• 
Creating and supporting working landscapes that bring together a diverse array of stakeholders with overlapping goals 



2. How is land use, resource management, and/or conservation important to the quality of life in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
It is essential. It ensures clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, bountiful food to eat, timber to build our homes, and rich landscapes to explore for us and future generations. 

• 
Provides direct and indirect sources of income for communities; creates direct and indirect impacts on the cultural values of a community, food availability, access to open space and community resiliency; provides ecosystem services such as clean water and air. The sustainable use will allow for similar or better quality of life for future generations. 

• 
Healthy ecosystems are essential to the economic, social, and environmental vitality of the region. 



3. What do you see as your primary goals and objectives in managing and conserving land in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
Increase the amount of intact and functional ecological systems throughout the region; enhance or develop sustainable community water sources; stabilize vulnerable populations of salmonids and other wildlife through continued development of novel and functional restoration in the floodplains and estuaries of the Lower Columbia and North Oregon Coast; engage local and diverse communities to conserve and steward land that has multiple benefits (e.g. cultural, economic, habitat). 

• 
Find the appropriate balance of resource protection and use. 

• 
Promote and protect biodiversity to give people, plants, and wildlife the best chance of adapting to the changing climate; implement conservation and management projects at a landscape or watershed scale as smaller projects make a greater impact when placed in the context of the larger landscape (it is all about connectivity); conservation contributes to a community where people, plants, fish and wildlife all thrive. 

• 
Continue to work to improve environmental conditions, eliminate limiting factors for wildlife; and connect with an even greater number of diverse stakeholders. 

• 
A conservation minded community; a resilient community (both socio-economic and natural) based on best science and climate change approach; community-owned and sustainably managed working forests; community owned and managed watersheds for clean drinking water. 

• 
Staying ahead of the curve on environmental issues that may impact watersheds in the future; following science and policy closely; growing participation of communities and stakeholders in natural resource management decisions. 




4. What are big impediments to managing and/or conserving land in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
Near-term challenges include: high cost of land, limited funding sources in Oregon for land acquisition and conservation, politics/political will, climate crisis, invasive species, development and population growth in rural areas, increasing homeless populations, growth in and use of rural areas is expanding exponentially and putting a lot of pressure on limited resources, corporate interest, effective communication in a world saturated by information, lack of trust. 

• 
50-year outlook and concerns: Long term stewardship of conserved lands; climate change – no certainty what the landscape will look like; keeping pace with development and recreational needs; population increase in Oregon and on the coast. 



5. Do you have ideas or suggestions for how to overcome these impediments, particularly through collaborative engagement among stakeholders? 
• 
By working together and having everybody’s voice represented, we can overcome anything. 

• 
Public engagement; innovative financing 

• 
Political reform; finance reform; better education 

• 
Community forests; diverse funding alternatives; community planning and strategic planning for at-risk communities; finding common ground across different groups 


Content added to the caucus: 
• 
Value all forests across the landscape 

• 
End monoculture DF forests; increase culturally significant species (ash, cedar) 

• 
Riparian restoration 


Top challenges: 
• 
Better local understanding of forest management for wildlife 

• 
Corruption of OR political system/weak laws 

• 
Loss of local control, especially timberlands (need locally owned and managed) 

• 
Long-term stewardship; policy for non-conversion 

• 
Growing tourism; infrastructure impacts, et. Climate resilient 


Top strategies to address challenges: 
• 
Invite tribal members; federal recognition of tribes 

• 
Campaign finance reform – OR; private volunteer 

• 
Community forests; develop funding system 

• 
Education/collaboration 





Recreation/Tourism Groups 
1. What values do you strongly hold for conservation and land management in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
Recreational access to public lands is important for both residents and visitors. 

• 
Walking, hiking, biking, sightseeing, bird and wildlife watching, and fishing and hunting are common recreational activities that require conservation and protection of natural resources to maintain the quality of the outdoor recreational experience. 



2. How is land use, resource management, and/or conservation important to the quality of life in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
Resource management and conservation are essential to maintaining the quality of the outdoor recreation experience for both residents and visitors. 

• 
Human health issues such as obesity can be reduced through outdoor recreation. Outdoor recreation is dependent upon accessibility to areas in which to recreate. 

• 
Accessibility to outdoor recreation can be constrained by economic well-being; people living in urban or suburban areas who cannot afford to drive distances to participate in outdoor recreation can still benefit from access to local/neighborhood trails that connect community features. 

• 
Tourism is an economic driver. Oregon and Washington are a draw to tourists because of the wealth of our natural resources. Visitors spend money while enjoying the view, participating in outdoor recreational activities and eating locally-sourced foods. 



3. What do you see as your primary near-term goals and objectives in managing and conserving land in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
Increased access and connectivity to and between outdoor recreational lands. 

• 
Public education on the importance of individual participation in stewardship 

• 
Outreach to private property owners provide information on liability laws that protect property owners regarding public access. 



4. What are big near-term impediments to managing and/or conserving land in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
Limited human resources and budget. Land management and conservation takes money and time. It can be difficult to raise funds or volunteers for efforts ranging from outreach to on-the-ground work including planting of trees, trash clean-up, and trail-building and long-term maintenance and management. 

• 
Enforcement of responsible recreational use is challenging in areas such as parking lots and boat ramps that are easily accessible via motorized vehicles. 

• 
Abuse, including garbage dumping and vandalism, by “the few” can affect the willingness of private property owners to support trail-building efforts. 

• 
It is challenging to increase connectivity between tracts of public lands that are separated by private properties for the above reasons. 




5. Do you have ideas or suggestions for how to overcome these impediments, particularly through collaborative engagement among stakeholders? 
• 
Increased participation through mixed-stakeholder group meetings such as this one in order to find common ground. 

• 
Inclusiveness as the underlying theme; it takes protection and conservation of all components to make a healthy environment. 


Top challenges: 
• 
Climate change “refugees” 

• 
Population growth (I-5 corridor) 

• 
Increased pressure on coastal resources 

• 
Inclusion of Chinook Indian Nation 


Top strategies to address challenges: 
• 
Using outdoor recreation for educational opportunities 

• 
Turn tourism into opportunities for landowners 

• 
Provide more recreational opportunities

1. What values do you strongly hold for conservation and land management in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
Respect for our natural resources and each other; honoring the importance of biodiversity and collaboration. 

• 
High quality fish habitat connected across land ownerships. 

• 
Ensure healthy natural resources, environment, and economy for Oregonians now and in the future. 

• 
Long term stewardship; resiliency in the face of climate change; connectivity; engagement of diverse audiences in conservation and stewardship; access to the outdoors and recreational opportunities. 

• 
Partnership, collaboration, and long-term trust with landowners and local partners; honoring land owner knowledge in planning for conservation; land management goals can be compatible with goals for fish and wildlife conservation. 

• 
We value Oregon’s unique and varied landscape of cities, farms and forests, rivers, beaches, and natural resources as they help to define who we are as Oregonians; we value comprehensive planning as a way to conserve and protect important lands and resources and to promote development of highly livable communities; we value partnerships to build consensus, increase capacity, and to champion the development of the best use of Oregon’s landscape. 

• 
Manage state forest lands to secure the greatest permanent value: managing them in a sound environmental manner to provide sustainable timber harvest and revenues to the state, counties, and local taxing districts. This management focus is not exclusive of other forest resources, but must be pursued within a broader management context that: 


o Results in a high probability of maintaining and restoring properly functioning aquatic habitats for salmonids, and other native fish and aquatic life; Protects, maintains, and enhances native wildlife habitats; Protects soil, air, and water; and Provides outdoor recreation opportunities. 

2. How is land use, resource management, and/or conservation important to the quality of life in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
Properly functioning ecosystems contribute to the health of the community and its way of life with the ecosystem services it provides (e.g. food, clean water, flood control, etc.) 

• 
Land use is a building block for the quality of life for the people in the northwest (and all) of Oregon.  It addresses all of the factors both tangible and inherent in our expectations to have a healthy and vibrant quality of life:  housing, employment, transportation & public facilities, parks & open space, beaches & ocean; environment protection, farms & forest. 

• 
Land conservation and resource management are integral to our quality of life.  We are deeply connected to our landscapes and watersheds and dependent on their health not only for basic human needs like clean air and water, but also for our sustenance in our economy -both natural resource-based industry as well as recreation and tourism. The well-being of a community is enhanced by access to green spaces and wild forests. 

• 
Conservation and economic sustainability are not mutually exclusive; preservation of NW Oregon’s natural communities is vital for the preservation of robust human communities; functioning environments provide clean water, clean air and an abundance of natural resources that extend across land ownerships; Oregonians appreciate the State’s beauty. 

• 
Parks provide economic benefit: a recent report found that the 293,000 visitors to Lewis and Clark National Historical Park in 2017 spent $16.8 million in communities near the park.  That spending supported 260 jobs in the local area and had a cumulative benefit to the local economy of $23.9 million.  Additionally, over 2 million people visit the state parks in Clatsop County. People stay here and move here for the natural beauty and closeness to nature. Resource potential is so great that it supported some of the densest Native American populations north of Mexico. 

• 
It is an important aspect of the way of life in northwest Oregon. The lands managed by the Oregon Department of Forestry fill a niche between industrial forest management and federal forest management. 




3. What do you see as your primary near-term goals and objectives in managing and conserving land in Northwest Oregon? 
• 
Restore and maintain habitat conditions to support viable fish and wildlife populations. 

• 
Focus restoration work on root causes rather than symptoms, increase landowner participation in restoration programs in strategic areas, smart planning for the long-term. 

• 
Emphasize restoration actions that both improve habitat conditions and work within natural watershed processes; assist landowners with finding incentives to protect and restore ecological communities within the framework of their business models; prevent development of natural lands and working lands by finding solutions to economic pressures. 

• 
Preserve for the benefit of the people of the US the historic, cultural, scenic and natural resources associated with the arrival of the Lewis and Clark Expedition; reestablish natural functions and processes in parks; partner on shared resource opportunities such as salmon recovery, invasive species, and habitat connectivity; cultivate the next generation of stewards by embracing relevancy, diversity, and inclusion. 

• 
Provide agricultural landowners with the knowledge and capacity to manage their lands for clean water and sustainable resources. 

• 
Manage ODF lands to meet the various goals set out by our Forest Management Plan; not doing the same thing everywhere; observe results of management activities; observe unmanaged areas; provide revenue to the counties. 

• 
Conserve productive farm and forest lands. Retain parcels of sufficient size to support commercial farm and forest production and limit uses that conflict with or impair farm and forest operations. 

• 
Protect and conserve coastal and marine resources. Provide policy, planning, technical, and grant assistance to local governments and state agencies to ensure compliance with coastal goals. 

• 
Protect and conserve wildlife habitat, wetlands and riparian areas for their ecosystem values. Guide development from riparian areas, wetlands, and wildlife habitat to less sensitive areas through better application of Statewide Planning Goal 5 (Natural Resources) in local comprehensive plan updates. 

• 
Protect scenic, historic, cultural, and recreational values on rural lands. 

• 
Address a reduced land base as more and more conservation and working lands are threatened by development and population growth; mitigating climate change impacts. 

• 
Protect and enhance fish and wildlife and their habitats for use and enjoyment by present and future generations. 

• 
Build resiliency into restored ecosystems to be responsive to climate change; recover imperiled species and rare habitats; visitors to the 250th Lewis and Clark anniversary experience thriving landscapes. 

• 
Reestablish natural biological communities and ecological processes; citizen and community based stewardship efforts for fish and wildlife conservation are common place; at risk species are recovered and populations are viable. 

• 
Adaptive management is key; observing results and capitalizing on them; learning from less than desirable results and adjusting methods to meet desirable outcomes; provide revenue to the counties. 




4. What are big near-term impediments to managing and/or conserving land in Northwest Oregon? 
Near term 
• 
Ag landowner awareness of their responsibility to prevent and control water pollution from agricultural activities; lack of funding; lack of effective landowner incentives to protect fish and wildlife habitats; complicated permitting processes and fees; increasingly divisive nature of the political landscape; timber markets driving shorter rotations; loss of local control over natural resource industries; habitat fragmentation; invasive species; attitudes of jobs vs environment or the concern that timberlands will be off-limits; looking narrowly at local projects rather than how the fit in with the broader picture; short term thinking that precludes long term viability of ecosystems for wildlife and natural resource economies; and data needs – where are corridor pinch points? What are the stream flows and temperatures in rivers? Dwindling skilled timber industry contractor workforce; increase in unauthorized public use of forests; uncertain regulatory climate pertaining to water quality, air quality, and threatened and endangered species. 

• 
Retiring family farmers and foresters will present new ownership opportunities. Succession planning is critical to ensuring land remains available for agriculture, forestry, and natural resource functions. 

• 
The projected increase in Oregon’s overall population will most likely present new challenges to housing supply, food systems, and other infrastructure. 

• 
Forest lands are a patchwork of ownership between industrial, small woodlot owners, state and federal entities with different management strategies that can conflict: fuel loads, new residential uses, etc.  

• 
The Forest Practices Act is not compliant with federal Coastal Non-Point Source Pollution Program requirements impacting federal funding and affecting the ability of the state, local jurisdictions, and non-profits to implement on the ground projects addressing clean water needs. 

• 
Lack of state matching funds reduces opportunities to leverage federal working lands/conservation funding. 

• 
Ballot Measures 49 and 56 limit the ability of DLCD to address changes in land use. 


50-year outlook 
• Population growth, increasing need for water and resources; lack of a regulatory framework aimed at protecting natural ecosystem-process function that impacts water quality/quantity and nature’s ability to create and maintain resilient fish and wildlife habitats; climate change, development pressure to convert natural areas and working land; impacts to wild areas from overuse as the population grows, urbanization leading to the antipathy of and disconnection from the natural world; growth of urban areas near forests will put more users in the forest; uncertain regulatory climate pertaining to water quality, air quality, and threatened and endangered species. 


5. Do you have ideas or suggestions for how to overcome these impediments, particularly through collaborative engagement among stakeholders? 
• 
Incentives for landowners to participate in restoration; particularly for projects that focus on addressing root causes rather than symptoms; resurgence of local control over natural resource markets; and public outreach to increase knowledge of contributions of conservation, agricultural, and timber lands. 

• 
Build trust and relationships to address community needs; encourage a culture of collaboration; understand that different groups can have different goals and strategies that are valid; find and focus on common ground: desire for clean water, clean air, healthy ecosystems, access to recreation, sustainable jobs, and abundant fish and wildlife; look at larger regional goals. 

• 
The growing recognition of the value of working lands as reservoirs of habitat and open space is very positive – continue to highlight successful partnerships that show how conservation and rural economies can mutually benefit; identify gaps in conserved/restored/ protected lands across the landscape and form collaboratives that seek to find common ground among stakeholders. 

• 
Engage professional organizations and research organizations when seeking information pertaining to natural resource management. ODF is required to engage with the public during planning processes. ODF will continue to do so. 

• 
Retiring family farmers and foresters will present new ownership opportunities. Succession planning is critical to ensuring land remains available for agriculture, forestry, and natural resource functions. 

o The Oregon Agricultural Heritage Program is intended to provide grants to assist in succession planning. Support for groups like Rogue Farm Corps, who provide succession planning training, is also critical. 

• 
The projected increase in Oregon’s overall population will most likely present new challenges to housing supply, food systems, and other infrastructure. 

o Planning is required to build strong communities and limit inefficient use of valuable rural lands. The 2018 Legislature allocated funding to DLCD, which was passed on as grants to 45 cities and counties for housing planning. DLCD has requested additional funding in 2019 (see HB 2075) for housing and economic development planning efforts. 

• 
Forest lands are a patchwork of ownership between industrial, small woodlot owners, state and federal entities with different management strategies that can conflict: fuel loads, new residential uses, etc.  

o This will require a combination of forest practice strategies, landowner coordination efforts, and land use planning. A community forest model may help stem the tide of forest loss, fragmentation, and degradation, while supporting an array of ecological services and providing fuel, fiber, jobs, and recreation to surrounding communities. 

• 
The Forest Practices Act is not compliant with federal Coastal Non-Point Source Pollution Program requirements impacting federal funding and on the ground projects addressing clean water needs. 

o 
Securing compliance through amendments to the Forest Practices Act would release federal funds to implement on-the-ground projects and secure additional staff at the state level. 

o 
DEQ is evaluating their Water Quality Limited Stream program as a way to address coastal water quality issues basin by basin. 



• 
Lack of state matching funds reduces opportunities to leverage federal working lands/conservation funding. 

o Oregon Agricultural Heritage Program and OWEB are partners in this effort. 

• 
Ballot Measures 49 and 56 limit the ability of DLCD to address changes in land use. 

o DLCD will continue to evaluate Measure 49 and 56 costs in future planning efforts. 

• 
DLCD can provide additional capacity at the local level around the land use elements of these challenges through Technical Assistance and facilitation/convening.

BREAKOUT SESSIONS 
Meeting attendees convened in diverse groups in five breakout sessions to answer two questions: 

• 
What steps do workshop attendees believe can/should be taken to achieve desired future conditions on the landscape? 

• 
What can people living and working in the region do together to achieve mutual goals, address challenges, and create the kind of landscape representative of the interests and values of people living in the region? 

• 
Collaboration 

o 
Collaborate around an education/outreach plan to communicate multiple values. 

o 
Recognition of tradeoffs or recognition that landscape has a place for all, then identify overlapping values. 

o 
We want to see a future that is not polarized. We can have tough conversations without judgment 

o 
Take care regarding vocabulary (extractive versus regenerative, consumptive versus non-consumptive) 

o 
Continue stakeholder communication process 

o 
Be open-minded! 

o 
Create a space for dialogue – expand on “trees and taps” – formal and informal
